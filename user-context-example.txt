I'm a software developer working on several projects:
- Project X (ID: PRJ-123): Backend API development in Node.js
- Project Y (ID: PRJ-456): Frontend application using React
- Project Z (ID: PRJ-789): Database optimization and cloud infrastructure

My work pattern usually involves:
- Morning: Focused coding sessions, usually on Project X
- Midday: Meetings and code reviews
- Afternoon: Frontend work on Project Y
- Occasional infrastructure tasks for Project Z

I need to track time for billing purposes, especially for Projects X and Y.
